# colormath

[![CI](https://github.com/ColorMath/ci/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ColorMath/ci/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

**Sixteen CI quality gates for Python web apps, in one `uses:` line.**

colormath is a reusable GitHub Actions workflow (plus the scripts and composite
actions behind it) that gives a Poetry-managed Python project a complete,
parallel CI gate suite: formatting, lint (Python and JS), types, docstrings,
alembic migration sync, import boundaries, tests, template lint, security,
secrets, accessibility, dependency CVEs (Python and JS), Dockerfile lint, and
per-change test coverage.

It grew out of a family of FastAPI + Poetry + Jinja/Tailwind apps deployed on
Cloud Run, but the gates apply to most Poetry projects — the JS-based gates
(frontend tests, JS lint, CSS lint, template accessibility) are driven by npm
scripts you define, and any gate can be switched off.

## Quick start

Create `.github/workflows/gates.yml` in your repo:

```yaml
name: Gates

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  gates:
    uses: ColorMath/ci/.github/workflows/gates.yml@v1.1.0
    with:
      python-version: "3.12"
      default-branch: main
```

Open a pull request and you'll get fourteen parallel checks (sixteen with the
opt-in `migrations` and `import-linter` gates), each posting a compact stats
block to the run summary. Project-specific jobs (deploys,
previews, seeding) stay in your repo as siblings that gate on the suite:

```yaml
  deploy-staging:
    needs: gates
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    # ... your deploy steps, unchanged
```

The [example/](example/) directory is a minimal compliant consumer — start
there to see every contract file in place. colormath's own CI runs the full
suite against it on every PR.

## The gates

| Gate | Tool | Enforces |
|---|---|---|
| `ruff` | [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) | formatting + lint |
| `tests` | vitest + pytest | `poetry.lock` in sync with pyproject, then JS and Python suites green |
| `typecheck` | [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) | type checks pass |
| `docstrings` | [interrogate](https://interrogate.readthedocs.io/) | docstring coverage ≥ your `[tool.interrogate]` fail-under |
| `migrations` | git (no deps) | branch not missing alembic migrations that landed on the base branch — **opt-in** until the next MAJOR |
| `import-linter` | [import-linter](https://import-linter.readthedocs.io/) | your `[tool.importlinter]` import contracts hold (layers / forbidden / independence) — **opt-in** until the next MAJOR |
| `jslint` | [eslint](https://eslint.org/) | hand-written JS passes lint |
| `styles` | [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) | design tokens only — no hardcoded colors/font-sizes |
| `templates` | [djlint](https://djlint.com/) | Jinja templates are well-formed (per `[tool.djlint]`) |
| `sast` | [bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/) | no Medium+ security findings in app source |
| `secrets` | [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) | no secrets anywhere in git history |
| `a11y` | [html-validate](https://html-validate.org/) | templates pass the a11y preset |
| `deps` | [pip-audit](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/) | locked, shipped deps have no actionable CVEs |
| `js-deps` | npm audit | locked, shipped JS deps have no high+ CVEs |
| `dockerfile` | [hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) | Dockerfile best practices |
| `diff-coverage` | [diff-cover](https://github.com/Bachmann1234/diff_cover) | changed lines ≥90% covered |

Two design choices worth calling out:

- **`diff-coverage`, not total coverage.** The gate requires the lines you
  *changed* to be covered. It never fails on pre-existing untested code, so
  you can adopt it on day one of a legacy codebase and ratchet quality up one
  PR at a time.
- **`deps` and `js-deps` audit what ships.** Locked versions are exported
  from `poetry.lock` for the production dependency groups only, and npm audit
  runs with `--omit=dev` — dev tooling never triggers a CVE failure, and
  local runs audit exactly what CI audits.
- **`migrations` catches alembic divergence before the merge.** A PR that
  branched before newer migrations landed on the base branch merges into
  multiple alembic heads. The gate diffs the base branch against the PR's
  merge-base, scoped to `migrations-path`, and fails with "pull in the latest
  `<branch>`" when the base moved. The base branch is your `default-branch`
  input when set, else discovered from the repo — main and master both just
  work.
- **`import-linter` enforces the architecture you write down.** The gate runs
  `lint-imports` against the contracts in your `[tool.importlinter]` — a
  layered dependency order, a module that must stay independent of another, a
  boundary a subsystem may not cross. Like the rest of the suite it needs no
  project deps (grimp builds the import graph by static analysis), and the
  rules are entirely yours: colormath ships the runner, your pyproject ships
  the contracts. Handy for invariants a reviewer can't reliably catch by eye —
  e.g. a worker entrypoint that must never import a FastAPI-coupled module.

## Adopting incrementally

Every gate has an `enable-<gate>` input (default `true`). On a codebase with
existing findings, land the caller with the failing gates disabled, burn the
findings down, and enable them one by one:

```yaml
    uses: ColorMath/ci/.github/workflows/gates.yml@v1.1.0
    with:
      python-version: "3.12"
      default-branch: main
      enable-a11y: false           # TODO: burn down template findings
      enable-diff-coverage: false  # TODO: enable once the suite measures coverage
```

Disabled gates show as *skipped* in the run — visible, never silently absent.

## Configuration

### Workflow inputs

All inputs are optional.

| Input | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `python-version` | `"3.12"` | Python for all Python gates |
| `node-version` | `"22"` | Node for all JS gates (html-validate 11.x needs ≥22) |
| `default-branch` | repo default | Base branch for diff-coverage |
| `workdir` | `"."` | Directory containing the app, for monorepos |
| `poetry-install-args` | `""` | Extra `poetry install` args, e.g. `"--with webapp,worker"` |
| `ruff-spec` | `"ruff>=0.14,<0.15"` | pip spec for ruff — match your pyproject pin |
| `ruff-select` | `""` (full lint) | Restrict `ruff check` to specific rules, e.g. `"I"` |
| `bandit-spec` | `"bandit>=1.9,<2"` | pip spec for bandit — match your pyproject pin |
| `interrogate-spec` | `"interrogate>=1.7,<2"` | pip spec for interrogate — match your pyproject pin |
| `interrogate-paths` | `"."` | space-separated paths for interrogate; scoped by `[tool.interrogate]` excludes |
| `migrations-path` | `"alembic/versions"` | migrations directory the `migrations` gate watches |
| `gitleaks-version` | `"8.30.1"` | gitleaks release to install |
| `djlint-spec` | `"djlint>=1.36,<2"` | pip spec for djlint — match your pyproject pin |
| `djlint-paths` | `"templates/"` | space-separated template paths for djlint; profile/ignores from `[tool.djlint]` |
| `import-linter-spec` | `"import-linter>=2,<3"` | pip spec for import-linter — match your pyproject pin |
| `hadolint-version` | `"2.14.0"` | hadolint release to install |
| `hadolint-dockerfiles` | `"Dockerfile"` | space-separated Dockerfile paths to lint |
| `npm-audit-level` | `"high"` | severity at which npm audit fails the `js-deps` gate |
| `diff-cover-fail-under` | `"90"` | Minimum % coverage on changed lines |
| `free-disk-space` | `false` | Reclaim runner disk first (heavy ML dependency trees) |
| `enable-<gate>` | `true` (`enable-migrations`: `false`) | Per-gate opt-out (see above); new gates ship opt-in |

### Files in your repo

| File | Needed for | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.bandit]` | `sast` | scan scope/excludes (plus your mypy/ruff config as usual) |
| `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.interrogate]` | `docstrings` | coverage threshold (`fail-under`) + excludes |
| `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.djlint]` | `templates` | djlint profile (e.g. `jinja`) + rule ignores |
| `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.importlinter]` | `import-linter` | your import contracts (root package(s) + layers/forbidden/independence) ([reference](example/pyproject.toml)) |
| `.colormath/audit.conf` | `deps` | poetry groups that ship + CVE allowlist ([reference](example/.colormath/audit.conf)) |
| npm scripts `test`, `jslint`, `styles`, `a11y` | the JS gates | see [example/package.json](example/package.json) |
| `eslint.config.js` + vendored `eslint.config.colormath.mjs` | `jslint` | thin caller of the shared eslint base ([reference](example/eslint.config.js)); devDeps `eslint`, `@eslint/js`, `globals` |
| `Dockerfile` | `dockerfile` | linted by hadolint ([reference](example/Dockerfile)) |
| `.colormath/ci.env` | optional | non-secret env sourced before pytest in CI |
| `.colormath/ci-extra-install.sh` | optional | extra install steps after `poetry install` (must be executable) |
| `.gitleaks.toml` | optional | gitleaks false-positive allowlist, used when present |

Once the checks are green, register each gate's job name as a required status
check in your branch protection (they appear as `gates / Ruff (format + lint)`
and so on) — and **remove the required contexts left over from your
pre-colormath workflow**. Old names never report under the suite, so each one
pins every PR at "Expected — waiting for status" and blocks merging.

## Optional: AI review + test plan

[review.yml](.github/workflows/review.yml) is a second reusable workflow —
entirely opt-in, adopted per project by adding a caller (skip the caller and
nothing changes). It runs two Claude agents in parallel on every non-draft PR
(re-runnable by commenting `@claude`):

- **review** — the "Thermonuclear Review": a deliberately adversarial audit of
  the diff across correctness, security, maintainability, and DevEx, posted as
  a tracking comment (marker line `## Thermonuclear Review`) with inline
  comments on the relevant lines.
- **test-plan** — classifies the diff (UI vs API surface) and posts a
  `## Test Plan` comment with concrete QA checklists, exposing a
  machine-readable verdict (`qa_depth`, `requires_ui_qa`, `requires_api_qa`)
  as workflow outputs for downstream QA jobs to gate on.

### Installing the review suite

Both agents run via `anthropics/claude-code-action`, which needs more than
the caller file — do these once per repo, in order:

1. **Install the [Claude GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/claude)** on the
   repo (or org). The action exchanges OIDC (`id-token: write`) for an app
   token and posts its comments as `claude[bot]` — without the app installed,
   the agents cannot authenticate to GitHub and the jobs fail at startup.
2. **Add the API key secret**:
   `gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --repo <owner>/<repo>`
   (an Anthropic API key with access to the model you configure; both agents
   share it).
3. **Add the caller workflow** below, pinned to an exact tag.
4. Optionally set `review-focus` to point the reviewer at your project's
   sensitive surfaces — without it the review is generic.

```yaml
name: claude-review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, ready_for_review]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  review:
    uses: ColorMath/ci/.github/workflows/review.yml@v1.1.0
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
      id-token: write
    secrets:
      anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
    with:
      review-focus: "Pay attention to <project-specific hot spots>."
```

Inputs: `model` (default `claude-sonnet-4-6`), `review-focus` (extra
project-specific emphasis for the reviewer), and `enable-review` /
`enable-test-plan` toggles. Requires an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` repo secret.

The `issue_comment` / `pull_request_review_comment` triggers are what enable
`@claude` re-runs, but they come with noise: GitHub can't filter comment
events by body at the trigger level, so **every** PR comment — including the
review's own two bot comments — creates a run that immediately skips. If you
prefer a quiet Actions tab, keep only the `pull_request` trigger and re-run
reviews from the Actions UI (or flip the PR draft → ready).

## Optional: Claude Code plugin

This repo is also a [Claude Code plugin marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces).
The `colormath` plugin ships skills for working in consumer repos — currently
**`/colormath:ship`**: take the current branch through the whole PR pipeline
(open the PR, watch the gates, wait for the Thermonuclear Review, triage
findings, apply small fixes) and stop at a merge recommendation — never
merging itself. Each skill's behavior, prerequisites, and contract
dependencies are documented in [plugin/README.md](plugin/README.md).

Install manually:

```
/plugin marketplace add ColorMath/ci
/plugin install colormath@colormath
```

or have a consumer repo offer it to everyone who opens it, via
`.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "colormath": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "ColorMath/ci" }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "colormath@colormath": true
  }
}
```

## Running the gates locally

Two files are vendored into every consumer at the pinned tag:
[Makefile.colormath](Makefile.colormath) (a local mirror of every gate, so
all consumers share the same `make` endpoints) and
[eslint.config.colormath.mjs](eslint.config.colormath.mjs) (the shared eslint
base — your `eslint.config.js` stays a thin caller; see its header for the
factory options and escape hatches). Vendor them once:

```sh
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColorMath/ci/v1.1.0/Makefile.colormath
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColorMath/ci/v1.1.0/eslint.config.colormath.mjs
```

then include the Makefile from yours, providing the one target it expects
from you (`test`) and setting knobs before the include if your project
differs:

```make
# COLORMATH_DIFF_COVER_BASE = origin/master   # example override
COLORMATH_PREFLIGHT_SKIP = templates          # mirror your enable-*: false flags
include Makefile.colormath

test: ## your mirror of the tests gate
	poetry run pytest tests/ && npm test
```

Now every gate has a same-named `make` mirror (`make jslint`, `make audit`,
`make dockerfile`, …), and `make preflight` runs the full suite minus
`COLORMATH_PREFLIGHT_SKIP` — keep that list in lockstep with the gates your
caller disables. The `audit` and `coverage-diff` targets fetch their gate
scripts from this repo at the file's own stamped tag, so local runs and CI
share one implementation. On upgrades, `make colormath-update REF=vX.Y.Z`
refreshes both vendored files — keep them in lockstep with your `gates.yml`
pin, and review the diff like any other dependency bump.

## Versioning and upgrades

One SemVer tag stream, and consumers pin **exact tags only** (`@v1.1.0`, never
a floating major tag): an upgrade should arrive as a reviewable PR whose diff
and changelog explain themselves — not as a surprise inside an unrelated one.

The rule for MAJOR: *if a consumer's CI can go from green to red without the
consumer editing anything, it's MAJOR.* New gates ship disabled-by-default in
a MINOR and are promoted to default-on in the next MAJOR. Details in
[LIFECYCLE.md](LIFECYCLE.md); release history in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
While on `0.x`, breaking changes may land in any release.

```

Planned next, on the same tag stream and exact-pin rule: a Copier template for
the in-repo files this stack shares (Dockerfile, Makefile, compose), and
Terraform modules for the Cloud Run deployment shape.

## Design principle

colormath ships **no runtime application code** — infrastructure only. The
10-second rule for what belongs here: would a sibling project copy this file
unmodified except for names, ports, and IDs? Then it belongs in colormath.
Does it mention a specific domain, or need more than ~3 template variables to
fit every project? Then it's a product decision wearing a costume; keep it in
your repo.

This repo is public so consumers under any GitHub owner can use every channel
without auth friction. Never commit real project IDs or secrets — the gitleaks
gate runs on colormath itself, and example values must stay obviously fake.
