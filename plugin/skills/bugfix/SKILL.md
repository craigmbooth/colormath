name: bugfix
description: Take a bug report all the way from raw report to merged fix — establish the facts the report left out (which environment, which surface, the literal repro), reproduce the defect against the running stack, fix it at the layer the invariant belongs to, add a regression test that fails without the fix, assess whether the defect already corrupted stored data and remediate that in the same PR, then hand off to /colormath:ship. Use this whenever someone reports something broken — a bug report, a pasted stack trace or error log, "why is X doing Y", "users can't Z", a production incident, a written-up findings doc — even when they never say the word "bug". Not for sweeping a whole feature area for unknown problems (that's /colormath:qa), and not for shipping a branch that's already fixed (that's /colormath:ship).

Turn the bug report in "$ARGUMENTS" into a merged fix.

A bug report is **evidence, not a specification**. It tells you what one person
noticed from outside the system; it rarely tells you where they were standing,
what they actually typed, or what the system did underneath. The failure mode
this skill exists to prevent is the natural one: read the report, form a
plausible theory, and spend an hour proving it against the wrong environment,
the wrong surface, or a bug that was never there. The cure is cheap — a few
targeted questions cost the reporter seconds, and reproducing the failure once
costs you minutes and converts every later step from guesswork into
verification.

So the spine is: **understand → reproduce → diagnose → fix → prove → remediate
→ ship.** Don't skip forward. In particular, don't start editing code before
you have watched the bug happen.

If "$ARGUMENTS" points at a file (a written-up report, an exported ticket, a
QA findings doc), read the whole thing first. If it's a stack trace or a log
excerpt, that's your best evidence — work backwards from the frames to the code
path, but treat the trace as the *symptom's* location, not the defect's.

## 1. Read the report, then find what's missing

Separate what the report actually **states** from what you are **assuming**.
Write both down for yourself. The assumptions are your question list.

These are the unknowns that most often send a fix down the wrong path:

- **Which environment.** Production, staging, a local dev stack, CI? This
  changes almost everything downstream: whether stored data is already
  corrupted, how urgent it is, what you're allowed to touch, and whether the
  code on the reporter's screen is even the code in your working tree.
- **Which surface.** The same user-visible symptom usually has several possible
  entry points — a public form, an invite acceptance, an admin action, an API
  client, a background job. Each has different code and different validation.
- **What literally happened.** The exact input, the exact steps, the observed
  result, and the expected result. Vague verbs are the big trap: "it's not
  recognizing it", "it doesn't work", "it fails" each describe several distinct
  bugs. Pin the verb down to an observable.
- **Which identity.** The account, its privilege tier, its tenant/org. Bugs
  that only bite one role are common and invisible if you test as an admin.
- **When it started**, and whether it reproduces for the reporter every time or
  happened once.
- **Blast radius.** One user or everyone; blocking or cosmetic; and — the
  question people forget — is it still actively producing bad data right now?

**Do a fast code pass before you ask.** Ten minutes of grepping the relevant
surfaces turns open-ended interrogation ("which surface?") into a concrete
multiple choice ("public signup form, invite acceptance, or admin-created
user?"). Concrete options are dramatically cheaper for the reporter to answer
and they surface the possibilities they hadn't considered. This is what
`AskUserQuestion`'s option lists are for.

**Ask only what changes what you'd do next**, and ask it in one batch rather
than trickling questions out over several turns. If the answer to a question
wouldn't alter your next action, you already have enough — proceed. If the
report is already specific enough to reproduce from, skip this step entirely
and say so.

If something is genuinely urgent — actively corrupting data, or blocking every
user — say that up front and offer the fastest safe path, rather than working
methodically through a long diagnosis while the bleeding continues.

## 2. Reproduce it against the running stack

A fix that isn't anchored to a failure you watched happen is a guess. This step
is what makes the rest trustworthy, and it's the one worth slowing down for.

Read the `qa` skill's `references/recon.md` before touching anything: bring the
stack up **only if it isn't already running** (don't reseed a working
environment out from under someone), and get credentials at the privilege tier
the report names — not just the most convenient admin account.

Reproduce at **the same surface and the same tier** the reporter used. Drive it
over the real transport — a browser for UI, `curl` or a small driver script for
API and backend paths — rather than calling functions in-process, because
in-process calls skip exactly the middleware, validation and serialization
layers where the defect often lives.

**Write the repro down as something runnable.** You'll use it three more times:
to confirm the diagnosis, to prove the fix, and as the seed of the regression
test. A one-line script beats a remembered sequence of clicks.

### When the report is from production

The local stack is not production, and the difference between them is often the
bug. Before concluding "cannot reproduce", work through what differs:

- **Configuration** — env vars, feature flags, providers wired to real services
  versus local fakes, different limits or timeouts.
- **Data that predates the current code.** Rows written before a constraint,
  validation, or migration existed will violate rules the current code assumes
  hold. Local seed data is usually pristine and therefore hides this entire
  class. Seeding a row in the shape the report implies is a legitimate way to
  reproduce.
- **Migration state** — a migration applied locally but not there, or vice versa.
- **Scale and concurrency** — races and N+1 collapses that only appear under
  real load or real row counts.

**Never modify production to investigate.** Reproduce locally, including by
constructing local data that mimics the production state you believe exists.

### If it won't reproduce

Stop and report — do not ship a speculative fix. Say plainly that you couldn't
reproduce it, then give the reporter something useful to push back on: what you
tried (surface, tier, inputs), what you *ruled out* and how, your leading
hypothesis and the specific piece of information that would confirm or kill it.
Often the missing piece is one detail the reporter can supply in seconds. A
wrong fix shipped confidently is worse than an honest "I need one more thing"
— it burns a review cycle and leaves the real bug live.

## 3. Diagnose: find the defect, not the symptom

The place an error *surfaces* is usually not the place it's *caused*. Trace
backwards from the observed failure until you reach the point where the system
first did the wrong thing — the moment a bad value was accepted, an invariant
went unenforced, a wrong branch was taken.

Then choose **the layer to fix at**, which is the decision that determines
whether this bug comes back. Fix where the invariant genuinely belongs, not
where it happened to be noticed. A validation added to one form leaves every
other route into the same invariant broken; the same rule enforced at the
service or model chokepoint closes all of them at once. Client-side checks are
never the fix — they're a nicety on top of a server-side rule.

**Enumerate the siblings.** A defect that reached users through one path
usually has siblings on the other paths into the same invariant: the other
callers of the function, the other routes that write the same field, the
background job that does the same work without the form's guard. Find every
entry point and confirm your chosen fix covers them. Fixing one and leaving
three is how a bug gets reported twice.

Keep the scope honest in the other direction too: fix **this** bug and its
siblings. When you notice unrelated problems nearby — and you will — write them
down and mention them at the end. Folding them in bloats the diff, muddies the
review, and makes it harder to tell what actually fixed the reported symptom.

## 4. Fix it, and prove the fix with a regression test

Make the change in the idiom of the surrounding code, following the repo's
`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` conventions and its layering rules.

Add a regression test **at the layer the fix lives at** — the chokepoint you
chose in step 3, so the test guards the rule itself rather than one caller of
it.

**Verify the test actually catches the bug.** A regression test that passes
with and without the fix is decoration. Prove the ordering: write the test
first and watch it fail, or temporarily revert the fix (`git stash`) and confirm
the test goes red, then restore and watch it go green. This takes a minute and
is the difference between a test that pins the behavior down and one that just
looks reassuring.

Then **re-run the original repro from step 2** against the running stack. A
green unit test is not proof the bug is gone — it proves the case you thought
of is gone. The repro is what the reporter actually did.

## 5. Remediate data the defect already corrupted

The code fix stops the bleeding. It does nothing about what already leaked —
and for a production bug, that's usually the half that matters to real users.
This step is skippable only when you've established the defect couldn't
persist bad state; say so explicitly rather than silently passing over it.

Ask: could this defect have written bad rows, files, or cached values? If so:

- **Characterize it precisely.** Write the query that identifies affected
  records. "Some users might be affected" is not actionable; "rows where X is
  set and Y is null" is.
- **Watch for the constraint trap.** If your fix adds a `NOT NULL`, `CHECK`,
  unique index, or newly-strict validation, existing violating rows will either
  fail the migration outright or lock those users out of a working system. The
  backfill has to land before or within the same migration as the constraint —
  check this explicitly, because it usually fails only in the environment that
  has the bad data, which is the one you can't test in.
- **Decide who can fix each row.** Some corruption is mechanically repairable
  (derive the right value, normalize the format) and belongs in a migration or
  backfill script in this same PR. Some genuinely isn't — information the
  defect destroyed can't be recovered by a script, and guessing at it is worse
  than leaving it. Put the repairable part in the PR and hand the rest over
  explicitly: name the affected records, say what a human needs to decide, and
  suggest how to reach them.
- **Test the remediation against local data shaped like the real thing.**
  Construct rows in the broken state, run the migration, confirm they come out
  right and that already-good rows are untouched. Confirm it's idempotent — a
  re-run must be a no-op, because it will be re-run.
- **Never run it against production yourself.** Ship it as a migration or a
  reviewed script, following the repo's migration conventions.

## 6. Ship it

- Commit on a branch — `fix/<short-slug>` — never on the default branch.
- Run the repo's full local gate mirror once (`make preflight`) before handing
  off, so an avoidable failure doesn't cost a CI round trip.
- Then invoke `/colormath:ship`, which takes it the rest of the way: PR, gates,
  review, the generated test plan executed against the running stack, fixes for
  anything that turns up, and either an auto-merge when it's genuinely clean or
  a hold with the reason.

Give ship a PR title naming the user-visible symptom, and make sure the body
carries what a reviewer needs and no reviewer can reconstruct on their own:
**the report** as received, **the repro** you ran, **the cause** you found,
**why the fix sits at that layer**, and **the data remediation** — including
anything you deliberately left for a human.

## Rules

- **Reproduce before you fix.** If you couldn't reproduce it, stop at step 2
  and report — never ship a speculative fix without saying plainly that it's
  reasoned rather than observed.
- **Never modify production**, and never run a remediation against it yourself.
  Investigation and repair both happen locally; production changes land through
  the PR.
- **Ask before anything leaves the machine** — outbound email through a
  configured provider, third-party API calls, writes to any shared environment.
  A dev `.env` often holds a *live* key, so "it's only the dev stack" is not a
  reason to assume a send won't really deliver. Offer to redirect locally.
- **Fix the reported bug and its siblings**, not everything you notice. Adjacent
  problems get written down and mentioned, not folded into the diff.
- Local state is yours to mutate while reproducing — record a baseline first so
  you can put it back, and clean up the rows, files and credentials you created.
- Your job ends where `/colormath:ship` takes over, and ship's own rules apply
  from there.
